    "\n",
    "Before diving into `while` loops, let's understand what loops are in general. Loops allow us to run a block of code multiple times. It's super handy when we want to do the same thing over and over again, like counting or going through items in a list. Python has two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `condition`: This is a test that evaluates to `True` or `False`. If it's `True`, the code block runs.\n",
    "- `# Block of code to execute`: This is where you put the code that you want to repeat."
