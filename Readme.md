# Welcome to our Intro to Python Course Repository! üåü

Hello, amazing educators! üë©‚Äçüè´üë®‚Äçüè´

We're thrilled to share with you this repository, a treasure trove of resources for teaching Python to 6th through 8th graders. This isn't your typical course content ‚Äì it's a journey into the exciting world of Python programming, tailored specifically for young, curious minds!

## What's Inside? üì¶

This repository holds a collection of slides and interactive Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are more than just a learning tool; they're a playground for students to engage with and create applications, all while learning Python. And guess what? They get to play with a virtual turtle! üê¢

## Course Structure üèóÔ∏è

The course is neatly divided into 7 comprehensive modules. Each module comes with its own interactive notebooks, a set of challenge problems to test understanding, and detailed lesson plans to guide your teaching journey.

### 1. **Variables and Calculations**
   Dive into the world of variables and basic arithmetic operations. Students
   will learn how to store data and perform calculations, a fundamental skill in
   programming.

   - **[Marp Slides](./slides/01_variables.md)**
   - **[Notebook](./notebooks/01_variables.ipynb)**

### 2. **Input/Output**
   Discover the magic of interaction! Students learn how to use `input` to
   gather data and `print` to display information, making their code converse
   with users. 

   - **[Google Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ys-_71AGSn3de3QUNSoiIKBlXTN83G4s?usp=sharing)**
   - **[Marp Slides](./slides/02_input_and_output.md)**
   - **[Notebook](./notebooks/02_input_and_output.ipynb)**

### 3. **Conditional Statements and Logical Expressions**
   Introduce decision-making in code. This module explores how programs can make
   choices using conditional statements and logical operators. 

   - **[Google Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ys-_71AGSn3de3QUNSoiIKBlXTN83G4s?usp=sharing)**
   - **[Marp Slides 1](./slides/03_01_logical_expressions.md)**
   - **[Notebook 1](./notebooks/03_01_logical_expressions.ipynb)**
   - **[Marp Slides 2](./slides/03_02_conditional_statements.md)**
   - **[Notebook 2](./notebooks/03_02_conditional_statements.ipynb)**

### 4. **Loops**
   Unravel the power of repetition in coding with loops. This is where students
   learn to automate tasks efficiently.

   - **[Google Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ys-_71AGSn3de3QUNSoiIKBlXTN83G4s?usp=sharing)**
   - **[Marp Slides 1](./slides/04_01_while_loops.md)**
   - **[Notebook 1](./notebooks/04_01_while_loops.ipynb)**
   - **[Marp Slides 2](./slides/04_02_for_loops.md)**
   - **[Notebook 2](./notebooks/04_02_for_loops.ipynb)**

### 5. **Lists**
   Jump into managing collections of data. Lists are powerful tools for
   organizing and manipulating multiple pieces of information. 

   - **[Google Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ys-_71AGSn3de3QUNSoiIKBlXTN83G4s?usp=sharing)**
   - **[Marp Slides](./slides/05_lists.md)**
   - **[Notebook](./notebooks/05_lists.ipynb)**

### 6. **Functions**
   Functions are like mini-programs within your program. This module helps
   students understand how to create and use these handy blocks of code.

   - **[Marp Slides](./slides/06_functions.md)**
   - **[Notebook](./notebooks/06_functions.ipynb)**

### 7. **Click Listeners**
   Click listeners are used to listen for clicks, and make your python code much
   more interactive. Use these to take your programs to the next level.

## Getting Started With Grader Than:

You can follow these steps to place this content in your students' workspaces automatically. It will appear in the code directory the workspace opens up to by default. 

**Prerequisites:** A [Grader Than Workspace setup](https://docs.graderthan.com/workspace/create/) is required.

1. Create a `Python Course Content` dependency. Please take a look at these [instructions](https://docs.graderthan.com/workspace/config/#create-a-dependency) for guidance on setting up a dependency.
2. Use the following script as your install guide for the `Python Course Content` dependency you just created:

   <details>
   <summary>Click to show dependency script</summary>

   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash

   crsdir="/home/developer/Documents/course-content"

   # Create the course content directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p "$crsdir"

   git_repo_url=https://github.com/graderthan/6-8-python-quick.git

   repo_name=$(basename -- "${git_repo_url}")
   repo_name="${repo_name%.*}"

   cd $crsdir

   if [ -d "./$repo_name" ]; then
      # The local repo exists.
      cd "./$repo_name"
      # Save student's local changes
      git stash save
      # Get the latest content
      git pull -X ours
      # Overwrite conflicting new changes with the student's saved changes 
      git stash pop
      git checkout --theirs .
      git add .
   else
      # The local repo does not exist b/c it's the first time.
      git clone "${git_repo_url}"
   fi

   # Set up the symbolic link
   src_dir="${crsdir}/${repo_name}/notebooks"
   dest_dir="/home/developer/Documents/code/notebooks"

   # Check if the destination directory exists. Create it if it doesn't
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest_dir")"

   # Create the symbolic link if it doesn't exist
   if [ ! -L "$dest_dir" ]; then
      ln -s "$src_dir" "$dest_dir"
   fi

   # If anything goes wrong, don't prevent the workspace from starting.
   exit 0
   ```

   </details>

3. **ü•≥ Completion!** Your students and course now have access to this learning content.

Learning to code should be fun, interactive, and accessible. With these resources, we hope to ignite a passion for programming in your students and equip them with the skills to explore the vast universe of coding.

Happy teaching! üçéüíªüåà
